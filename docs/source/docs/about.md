### Chinese Quartet (Quality Control and Data Integration of Multi-omics Profiling)

Please access [https://chinese-quartet.org](https://chinese-quartet.org) for requesting reference materials and assessing your multi-omics datasets.

Multi-omics (or molecular phenomics) profiling at the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels is the cornerstone of high-throughput technologies for discovering biomarkers for precision medicine. However, the lack of quality control procedures of multi-omics profiling during data generation and data analysis can lead to false findings, raising serious concerns about the reliability of multi-omics studies.

The Quartet Project provides publicly accessible multi-omics reference materials and practical tools to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of multi-omics results. Well-characterized multiomics reference materials and quality control metrics pertinent to precision medicine study purposes can be used to measure and mitigate technical variation, enabling more accurate cross-batch and cross-omics data integration in increasingly large-scale and longitudinal studies such as the International Human Phenome Project.

The Quartet project is designed in Fudan University (Shanghai, China). The Quartet multi-omics reference materials and datasets are publicly available and accessible. The recipients of the Reference Materials are highly encouraged to share their data with Fudan University through the Quartet Data Portal in order for us to improve the reference datasets and to better serve the community.
